# Refactor Summary & Resolved Issues

This document summarizes the major architectural refactor and the resolution of previously identified issues.

---

## 1. Global State Management with Zustand

The application has been refactored to use **Zustand** as a global state manager.

-   **Problem Solved:** Eliminated "prop-drilling" where state was passed through multiple component layers. The main `app/page.tsx` component is no longer a bloated state manager.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   A central store was created at `store/appStore.ts`.
    -   All application state (UI toggles, API data, search results) is now managed in the store.
    -   Components now connect directly to the store to get the data and actions they need, simplifying the component tree.
-   **Outcome:** The codebase is now more organized, predictable, and easier to maintain. State changes are more efficient, reducing unnecessary re-renders.

## 2. Notion as the Source of Truth

The data flow has been redesigned to treat Notion as the authoritative source for all saved food items.

-   **Problem Solved:** Previously, the app would show stale data from the USDA API even if an item had been updated in Notion.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   A new API endpoint (`/api/notion/database/[databaseId]/pages`) was created to batch-fetch saved items from Notion.
    -   The Zustand store now fetches all saved items on initial connection and stores them in a `savedFoodItems` state.
    -   The `FoodCard` component was refactored to prioritize rendering this `savedFoodItems` data, falling back to the USDA API only for new, unsaved items.
-   **Outcome:** The UI now consistently displays the most up-to-date information, reflecting any user edits made in Notion.

## 3. Component & Layout Refactoring

The component architecture and routing layout have been significantly improved.

-   **Problem Solved:** Deprecated and unused components cluttered the codebase. The main layout (Header, Sidebar) would re-render on every page navigation.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Removed unused components: `FoodResultsList`, `Sidebar`, `FoodSearchForm`, `NotionSettings`, `Collapsible`.
    -   Moved the `Header` and `NavigationSidebar` into the root `app/layout.tsx` to create a persistent, shared layout.
    -   The `NavigationSidebar` now correctly highlights the active route.
-   **Outcome:** A cleaner codebase and a smoother, more professional user experience with no layout shifts during navigation.

## 4. Specific Bug Fixes (Resolved)

All specific bugs outlined in `additional-issue-details.md` have been addressed through the refactor:

-   **Issue 1 (Conditional Logic):** The `FoodCard` "Save/Update" logic is now robustly tied to whether the item exists in the Notion-backed state.
-   **Issue 2 (Incorrect Rendering):** Resolved by making Notion the source of truth (see point 2).
-   **Issue 3 (UI Routing):** Resolved by implementing the shared `layout.tsx` (see point 3).
-   **Issue 4 (Misc. UI):** The Notion modal height and `FoodCard` focus issues have been fixed.
-   **Double Toast Notifications:** The unified state management has eliminated the race conditions that caused duplicate toasts.
